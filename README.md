🎓 I am graduated in Design Graphic and Pos Graduate in Design UX/UI.

I also love UX Design 😍. I like to create beautiful interfaces to provide the user with a great experience. To create prototypes I love to use Figma.

I like project architecture, writing clean code and applying good practices.

The only certainty I have is that learning is an endless road and I want to stay on it. So, I love technology, coffee and applying knowledge to solve problems, create solutions and impact lives. 💜
